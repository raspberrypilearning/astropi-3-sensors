<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
Now that you have your sensor detecting and displaying the temperature with the LED array, why not make it a bit more interesting?!
</div>
<div>

</div>
</div>

You could:
+ Display other sensor values using the LED array
+ Design and display images instead of solid colour using `sense.set_pixels()`
+ Create animations to display sensor values
